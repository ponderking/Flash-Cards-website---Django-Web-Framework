# Flash Cards

Flash Cards aim to allow users to create their own stacks of flash cards separated by the subjects they are studying and memorizing, and share these within their communities.

To install the application:

1. Install Python3 and Django
2. Clone this repository somewhere
3. Run database migrations from within the project folder with "python3 ./manage.py migrate"
4. (First time only!) Create a local super-user with "python3 ./manage.py createsuperuser"
5. Start the development server with "python3 ./manage.py runserver"
